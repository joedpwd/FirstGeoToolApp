# FirstGeoToolApp

I built this small app as a starter to learning about GIS applications and using the GeoTools library.

A simple GIS app of a map of the world. The map consists of 2 layers, a raster layer of a coverage of the world and a feature layer
of the countries of the world with attributes such as the country name and the shape (polygon) of the country. The app allows you to
manipulate the map using generic utilies provided by the GeoTools library. This includes moving the map, zooming in and out and
removing and inserting the two layers.
